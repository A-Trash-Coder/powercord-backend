easier when using Powercord or working with our APIs. 

Since they are very useful and made by very cute people we've listed them all here so you can easily find some
good high:tm: quality:tm: stuff.

## Powercord Manifest Generator
 - By [ghostlydilemma](https://github.com/ghostlydilemma) aka emma ðŸŒº
 - https://ghostlydilemma.github.io/powercord-manifest-generator

A visual tool that lets you create manifests for both plugins and themes without having to bother writing
the JSON structure yourself.

## BetterDiscord Theme Converter
 - By [creatable](https://github.com/Cr3atable)
 - https://cr3atable.github.io/Powerconvert

A stupidly simple tool that'll convert your BetterDiscord theme to a Powercord theme (will give you a zip with both
the theme and the manifest file). Supports both old and new META format.

>info
> Themes using BetterDiscord normalized classes (.da-) won't be able to be converted using this tool.

## BetterDiscord Compatibility Layer
 - By [Juby210](https://github.com/Juby210)
 - https://github.com/Juby210/bdCompat
<!-- - [See in the Plugins Store]() -->

A compatibility layer that lets you run BetterDiscord plugins directly in Powercord. As per community feedback, the
support seems pretty good and you won't encounter issues running most if not all plugins. It can also provide
EnhancedDiscord compatibiliy through a [BD plugin](https://github.com/Juby210/EDPluginsLoader)
