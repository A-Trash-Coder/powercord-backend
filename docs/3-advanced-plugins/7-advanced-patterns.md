# Advanced Patterns
If you want to make more technically challenging plugins, or need some really specific injection techniques or to
get some modules you seem unable to get, you've come to the right place.

This is a collection of really advanced techniques, crafted overtime by Powercord Developers and the community to
achieve what may seem impossible at first. Note that here, we'll consider you've mastered JavaScript and have a
deep understanding of React.

Even if we do a lot of the dirty work behind the scenes, it's still really recommended to understand what's going
under the hoods to understand the errors you'll face, or any weird behavior occurring.
